      <description>Project: New pet food supplements brand - Packaging samples | Client: Ibelfaren Pets | Year: 2020
Description: Packaging samples for sub brand of Belgium healthy plant growth solutions. Ibelfaren pets and their probiotic tonikum increase the quality of your pets life. We created a badge from simple illustration (pictogram), sub brand name and short description of probiotic product. Few health targeted words above the badge with heart in the middle - which is a significant point of the whole supplement legacy.</description>
