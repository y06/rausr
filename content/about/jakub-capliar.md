intro_title: "How I See Graphic Design"
intro_body:
  - "I prefer the practical side of design over pure aesthetics — because what really matters is how well it performs in the real world. Recognition comes before beauty. I focus on creating quick, usable definitions with unique communication elements."
  - "Practicality always wins over some colossal, 100-page, pixel-perfect brand manual that no one can actually work with — where you're forced to follow a hundred rigid rules just to use a logo or headline."
expertise:
  - "Print Design"
  - "Brand Design & Identity"
  - "UX/UI Design"
  - "Editorial Design"
  - "DTP"
achievements:
  - "Designed complex, high-impact exhibition stands for leading firms across Europe."
  - "Introduced innovative workflow improvements in graphic print studio operations."
  - "Helped define new standards for modular exhibition stand solutions."
  - "Led e-commerce rebranding and transformation projects, including complete redesigns of shop workflows, architecture, and functionality."
