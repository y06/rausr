### Madness Web – UX & UI for Ecommerce  
#### Modular filtering, responsive logic, and administrative tooling  

This project involved a full-scale redesign of the Madness Advertising ecommerce platform, specializing in modular presentation systems and related accessories. The objective was to architect an interface that could efficiently surface highly structured product data, while maintaining accessibility and visual consistency across devices.

The front-end UI prioritizes progressive disclosure and clarity in path-to-purchase flows. A modular filtering system enables users to navigate a broad taxonomy of products, accommodating parameters such as type, size, and material. Responsive layouts were implemented to maintain functional parity across desktop and mobile viewports, with emphasis on real-time feedback and reduced interaction latency.

We approached the interface like a flowchart—each user input had to yield a direct and contextual response. The system should guide without guessing.

On the administrative side, the platform includes tools for product catalog management, real-time inventory editing, and streamlined order fulfillment workflows. The internal dashboard architecture supports user-generated content moderation, dynamic tagging, and customer service integration.

The final system balances performance, scalability, and maintainability—designed to handle both high user traffic and frequent product updates without compromising usability or backend clarity.
