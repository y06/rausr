### Project Overview

Ernest Hemingway’s “The Sun Also Rises” is a cornerstone of 20th-century literature—introspective, sharp, and quietly devastating. Yet, too often, this novel is wrapped in covers that fail to communicate the nuanced world within. This design project was born from a desire to reflect the emotional rhythm of the story—its dry humor, existential longing, and fragmented postwar identity—through visual language. It asks: what if a classic could look as fresh and stirring as it still feels?

### Design Intent

The visual approach focuses on restraint and resonance. The rising sun is not just a title reference—it becomes the central symbol of hope, of days repeating, and of lives lived in quiet turmoil. The front cover uses a minimal but structured layout that emphasizes open space, like the pauses in Hemingway’s own writing. A warm color gradient evokes the early morning light of Spain and France, where much of the novel is set.

The typography is purposefully modern, yet stoic. Words are placed as Hemingway might place them—carefully, clearly, and with weight. One of the guiding sentiments in the design process came from the book itself:

{{< quote >}}
You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another.
{{< /quote >}}

This quote inspired the use of centering elements and still compositions, anchoring the visual identity in place even as the characters drift emotionally.

### The Result

The final design achieves a balance between poetic understatement and cultural relevance. It avoids cliché while embracing the novel’s atmosphere. The book, when displayed, invites reflection before even being opened. It speaks to new readers and longtime admirers alike, proving that the soul of a literary work can be honored through contemporary design.

Shown as part of a personal editorial design exhibition, the cover has sparked conversations not only about Hemingway’s work, but about how design can bridge time, genre, and emotional memory.
