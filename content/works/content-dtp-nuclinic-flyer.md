### Project Overview

A quick-turnaround flyer created for Nu’Clinic to support a women’s beauty awareness event. The design needed to be clean, calming, and clearly highlight the clinic’s services and promotional offers.

### Design and Production

Due to time constraints, the visual concept had to be simple yet professional. Soft gradients and balanced whitespace were used to keep the layout approachable and aesthetic. Photo editing focused on softening skin tones and enhancing clarity for print.

### The Result

The flyer was delivered on time and printed in high resolution, successfully serving its role during the clinic’s in-house event. Despite the rush, the result was clean and aligned with the brand’s visual identity.
