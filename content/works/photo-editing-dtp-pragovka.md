### Project Overview

Pragovka is a cultural and art district in Prague, known for its creative studios, artist residencies, and experimental programming. For the Eventfest 2019 exhibition, they needed a branded stand that could balance clean visual storytelling with a raw, creative energy—backed by precise print production.

### Production and Execution

We handled photo editing, layout templating, and DTP preparation for a range of large-format materials. The setup included PVC hard foam panels wrapped in plotted foil and sublimated backlit textiles. All assets were calibrated for output precision—matching colors across substrates and scaling elements for maximum clarity.

You’re not just printing graphics at this scale—you’re translating mood into materials, and making sure it holds up under spotlights and foot traffic.

### The Result

The final stand presented a structured yet expressive visual identity that echoed Pragovka’s interdisciplinary spirit. The graphics stayed sharp and coherent across materials, creating a cohesive micro-environment that stood out in a busy exhibition hall.
