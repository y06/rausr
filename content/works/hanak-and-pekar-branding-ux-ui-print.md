### Project Overview

Hanak & Pekar is a small craft-based painting company that approached us to create a simple but complete “mini-branding” package — [logo](/works/logo-collection/), visual elements, color palette, and a small website. The goal was not to portray them as a large corporation, but as dependable professionals with a modern, clean presence.

### Branding & Logo

The logotype was built from the names of both owners and paired with soft paint-splash elements that became a recognizable visual code across print and digital. The palette uses calm, bright tones that feel fresh and friendly, without falling into outdated craft clichés.

### Website & UX/UI

We prepared a lightweight single‑page website concept showing services, gallery, and quick contact options. The navigation is minimal and intuitive, supported by expressive paint‑drop graphics and generous white space. A short prototype video demonstrates user interaction, scrolling behavior, and simplified structure for mobile.

### Print Collateral

Business cards and simple document materials were designed to feel consistent with the website — clean layout, clear typography, and small decorative details from the paint-splash system. Everything was prepared for quick [DTP production](/tags/dtp/).

### The Result

A compact but complete identity that feels modern, friendly, and professional. Small company, big clarity — exactly what they asked for.
