### Client Brief

A modern, easy-to-assemble exhibition stand that can be adapted to various booth sizes depending on availability at different trade fairs across Western and Central Europe.

### Internal System Brief

The stand is built from independent modules that can be repositioned or removed as needed. An ideal solution is a lightweight aluminum frame system made up of components no longer than 1 meter, facilitating easy transport. The frame is designed to accommodate cladding with a variety of materials depending on the event or environment.

### Visual and Graphic Design Brief

A minimalistic design based on typography and the client’s corporate colors. We aimed to clearly convey the company’s core activity at first glance—what they offer and what they sell. The graphic layout was carefully developed to be reusable across various floorplans and layouts.

### Materials Used

#### The following materials were selected:
- Textile Fabric Backlight
- Textile Fabric Black-Back
- Popup Magnetic Materials

#### Special requirement for the exhibition floor:
The client requested a modular exhibition floor with custom print. We selected the “Stand On Floor” system from [ABC Display - Stand On Floor](https://www.stand-on.com), which fully meets the original brief. It consists of 50 x 50 cm tiles that allow for integrated cable routing beneath the decorative surface and support fully customized graphic inserts.
- The floor base material is high-strength PVC.
- The printable surface material is Display Flat 420g.
