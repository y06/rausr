### Project Overview

A modular exhibition stand created for Takeda, the Japanese pharmaceutical company, tailored for regional events and smaller pharmaceutical expos. The goal was to communicate calm, trust, and heritage through minimal visual language.

### Design Direction

The layout integrated nature-inspired photography, clean white backgrounds, and light wood textures. The print setup was prepared for easy reusability in different space configurations, and required high precision in DTP to ensure seamless panel alignment.

### The Result

A composed, lightweight presence that mirrored the brand’s values—subtle, trustworthy, and rooted in both science and nature.
