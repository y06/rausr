### Project Overview

This project involved graphic layout and photo editing for a modular popup wall, developed for Bolloré Logistics at a logistics-focused trade event in Austria. The system featured high-resolution prints mounted via magnetic panels for quick on-site assembly.

### Materials and Execution

The wall consisted of matte-finished PVC popup panels, designed for durability and reduced glare under exhibition lighting. Graphics were carefully aligned across multiple panels to maintain visual continuity. During photo editing, lighting and contrast adjustments were made with viewing angles and distance in mind to optimize clarity.

When you're designing across joined panels, you're not just thinking about layout—you’re thinking about how the eye stitches fragments into a whole from three meters away.

### The Result

The final design delivered a crisp and cohesive visual that reinforced Bolloré’s brand identity. Its modularity ensured flexibility for future reuse, while the overall presentation offered a professional, high-impact presence on the exhibition floor.
