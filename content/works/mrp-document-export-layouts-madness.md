### Project Overview

[Madness Advertising](https://madad.sk) uses an MRP system to generate commercial documents across the full order lifecycle—price offers, order confirmations, and invoices. The project focused on redesigning these exports into a single, consistent layout system that visually matches the client’s e-commerce experience while staying production-ready for real-world data.

### Client Brief

The client needed document exports that:

- Look and feel like the e-commerce brand system (typography, spacing, hierarchy)
- Stay readable even with dense tables, long item names, and multi-page documents
- Prioritize PDF delivery for customers and internal teams
- Include a clear review layer for corrections—so DTP and graphic designers get actionable feedback

### Internal Brief

We approached the redesign like a product UI system—except the “screen” is a PDF. Internally, the goal was to build a scalable template structure that can be reused across document types and extended later without redesigning everything from scratch.

Key decisions included:

- Unifying header blocks, address modules, and table components across all exports
- Defining consistent spacing and typographic rules so every document reads the same
- Treating the PDF as the primary output (print becomes secondary)
- Building a print-preview QA mode with annotations for fast review cycles

### Print-Preview QA (Notes + Zooms)

To reduce back-and-forth, the print preview includes a structured feedback layer:

- Highlight problematic areas directly in the preview
- Add zoom callouts for details that need attention
- Attach correction descriptions and notes for DTP / graphic designers

If any issue is present, the whole preview is flagged as problematic. If everything checks out, the preview is marked green as **OK**.

### The Result

A consistent, modern document system that matches the brand’s web experience—optimized for sharing, archiving, and approvals in a PDF-first workflow.

DF-first is no longer a trend — it’s the standard. Print is just one of the possible outputs, and a kind of reality check.
