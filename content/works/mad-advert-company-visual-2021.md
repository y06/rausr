### Project Overview

Almost each year brings a new wave of product launches, exhibitions, and public-facing events—making it essential to update the visual identity with a fresh, relevant direction.


This year’s concept builds on the foundation of the existing design system, maintaining a sense of continuity while introducing refined elements and visual clarity. The updated approach needed to strike a balance between familiarity and innovation, working seamlessly across formats and scales.

The result is a cohesive visual language tailored for both offline and online communication, from print materials and exhibition graphics to digital platforms and social media.

### Client Brief

The client requested a visual identity that was simple, flexible, and easy to maintain internally. Typography was to play a leading role, complemented by a vibrant system of geometric shapes and patterns to bring energy and character to the brand.

The solution needed to be adaptable for a wide variety of applications.

### The Result

The final visual identity delivers a refreshed yet familiar look—one that respects the brand’s existing design while introducing a more vibrant and contemporary voice. Centered around clean typography and playful geometric compositions, the system is flexible enough to support a broad range of content across print and digital media.
