### Project Overview

Visual identity and print production for Konica Minolta’s technology showcase booth, designed to represent their full range of business printing services. The concept had to express clarity, innovation, and modular adaptability across various formats.

### Materials and Execution

The booth featured PVC popup panels and PVC backlit graphics, designed for maximum durability and visual clarity. Each segment was prepared in high resolution for large-scale output and optimized to fit modular structures without distortion or misalignment.

In this case, we weren’t just delivering clean DTP—we were shaping the whole print experience. Every element had to align: from technical precision to color consistency to the way materials worked together in light.

### The Result

A cohesive visual setup that communicated technological precision and strong brand presence. The final execution ensured seamless integration of design across illuminated and non-lit surfaces, with attention to detail in material contrast and composition.
