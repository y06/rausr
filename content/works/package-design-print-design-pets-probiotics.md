### Project Overview

Packaging design for a new line of pet food supplements under a Belgian sub-brand of plant-based health solutions. The goal was to create compact, attractive packaging that communicates trust and care for pets' well-being.

### Client Brief

Design a badge-based label with minimal graphics that clearly reflects the product’s function. The label includes a simple pictogram, the sub-brand name, a short descriptor, and key benefits such as health, digestion, and vitality—highlighted with a heart symbol that anchors the whole composition.

### The Result

This compact packaging combines a clean, pharmaceutical look with emotional warmth.

Clean and minimal, this label features a circular badge with pet icons and the brand name, evoking care and trust. Keywords like STRONG, LOVE, HEALTH, and NATURAL clearly convey product benefits, supported by a heart symbol for emotional appeal. The yellow cap adds freshness, while “Made in Belgium” reinforces authenticity.
