### Clients Brief

Our site has become a bit outdated in recent years because we were focused solely on client projects. A redesign is knocking on the door, louder with every knock. Competitors are a few steps ahead, using modern design elements and constantly bringing something new to their clients. At this moment, we can’t fully describe our design ideas, so it would be better if you could prepare them in your own way.

### Whats we want to achieve 

The new site refresh must create and evoke (and here comes the cliché part) a wow effect—exactly the same way our video work impacts the audience. Our mission is to catch up with rivals, maybe even surpass them. A large part of our clients’ videos are illustrated and animated, so this should be reflected and made clear right from the landing page. Try to keep the color tone consistent with the company logo—various shades of green, from brighter tones to deep forest green.

### The Result

The final landing page design delivers a fresh and modern look with clean typography and bright highlights. A hero illustration emphasizes the creative and animated nature of the client’s video production. Clear CTAs guide the user to get started or explore the portfolio, while the use of gradient backgrounds and brand-consistent green tones create a contemporary, professional impression. Partner logos at the bottom reinforce trust and credibility.
