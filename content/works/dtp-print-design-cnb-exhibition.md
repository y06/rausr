### Project Overview

For a public-facing financial exhibition, the Czech National Bank (CNB) required a modular stand system that would convey institutional credibility while remaining visually approachable. The setup included both a primary backdrop and a freestanding counter unit.

### Visual and Material Execution

The design centered around a pattern of silhouetted coins—drawn from the CNB brand system—and applied using backlit stretch textile. These materials were selected to preserve sharpness and vibrancy under different lighting conditions. Print resolution and textile tension were calibrated to ensure edge-to-edge alignment across modular components.

We wanted the stand to feel grounded and official—but with a detail like the coin pattern that invites a second look, especially when it lights up.

### The Result

The finished booth balanced formality with visual nuance. Backlit coins provided a subtle focal point that reinforced national context without overwhelming the layout. The installation retained its visual clarity from close up or across the room, and maintained brand consistency throughout.
