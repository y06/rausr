### Project Overview

T3works manufactures modular exhibition stands designed for trade shows and corporate events across Central Europe. The systems are compact, reconfigurable, and require updated visuals with each new installation season. The 2020 brief called for a brand refresh that would retain structural clarity while adapting to evolving design expectations.

### Visual Direction

The direction focused on merging clean technical lines with modular graphical blocks—an approach that visually echoes the flexibility and engineered precision of the system. The layout was kept minimal, allowing the form of the stand and printed panels to do most of the expressive work. Color and contrast were used strategically to maintain visual balance across different lighting conditions at events.

When designing for modular systems, you're always thinking in fragments—what overlaps, what repeats, and how the viewer's eye travels through structure and scale.

### The Result

The outcome was a unified graphic system that retained clarity at multiple scales—whether viewed close-up on a panel or across the full exhibition build. The visuals emphasized a bold yet neutral tone, adaptable for a wide range of event setups without feeling generic. The system is still in use today across several regional installations.
