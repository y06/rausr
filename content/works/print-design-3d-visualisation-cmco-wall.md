### Project Overview

A rush project for CMCO, a supplier of lifting and motion control products. The goal was to deliver a strong visual presence for an internal event using [modular textile wall system](https://t3works.sk).

### Visual Production

The visual layout was designed to span an 8-meter-wide surface, printed on tensioned textile and assembled from modular frame segments. The 3D visualizations helped the client approve the concept rapidly before going into production.

### The Result

Even on a tight timeline, the final output maintained high fidelity and professional presence. The visual covered the full span cleanly and matched the brandâ€™s engineering precision and scale.
