### Project Overview

ANOMALIA was a small, independent design studio focused on experimental and creative visuals. We developed their entire brand identity—from name and logotype to web experience and interaction design.

### UX & UI Approach

The microsite was built as a bold visual playground that combined SVG animation, unorthodox layout, and clean typography. Motion was used not for decoration, but as a functional storytelling layer. A custom logo animation adapted dynamically depending on user scroll and device.

### The Result

Though the studio had a short lifespan, the identity and web presence remain a compact example of energetic, boundary-pushing design. It was a fast sprint with a sharp creative peak—and a fun ride all the way.
