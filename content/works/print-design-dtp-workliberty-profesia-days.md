### Project Overview

Printed presentation visuals created for Work Liberty and Crezar during their participation at Profesia Days—Slovakia’s largest job fair aimed at young professionals and talent seekers.

### Design and Materials

The goal was to keep the message bold and accessible while maintaining a clean layout for fast readability. Materials included textile walls, banners, and tabletop prints, all prepped through precise DTP adjustments and quick turnaround.

### The Result

The visuals helped present Work Liberty as a vibrant, youth-focused employer brand, clearly visible and recognizable across a busy exhibition floor.
