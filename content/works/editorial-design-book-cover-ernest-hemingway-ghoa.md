### Project Overview

Ernest Hemingway’s “Green Hills of Africa” is a reflective work of non-fiction blending travel writing, memoir, and poetic description. The book invites readers into East Africa’s landscapes and Hemingway’s mind—his love for hunting, literature, and the struggle of self-worth. This project reimagines its visual identity for a contemporary audience, with a tone that respects its introspective and rugged character.

### Design Intent

The cover features a muted color palette and blocky silhouette forms, reminiscent of the East African terrain. The green tones evoke vitality and wilderness without leaning into clichés. A low sun crests over hills, emphasizing Hemingway’s meditative pacing and stillness. The typography is modern and deliberately sparse, allowing the composition to breathe while grounding the design in seriousness.

I had never felt the same about anything that I had written. – Hemingway writes within the book, and this sentiment helped guide a cover that feels deeply personal and rooted in place.

### The Result

This redesign interprets the narrative not just as travelogue, but as a study of solitude, masculinity, and the search for beauty. It bridges classic literature with minimalist modernism, offering a tactile, elegant presentation suitable for bookshop shelves or gallery walls.
