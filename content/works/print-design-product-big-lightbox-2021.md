### Project Overview

New advertising product from the large-format category required a fresh visual. The wall is backlit with powerful LEDs, which is why we used high-contrast color ratios for maximum impact. The final result is visually strong and effective.


### Client Brief

Create a print visual for a new double-sided backlit wall product that draws attention through contrast and clean design. Intended for high-traffic showroom and exhibition spaces.

### The Result

The final print was produced on a premium textile backlight material to ensure vibrant color and clarity under LED illumination. The client praised the sharpness and contrast of the design, noting that it exceeded expectations in terms of visibility and visual impact.

Both the black and white versions were showcased during the product launch, offering flexibility for different environments.
