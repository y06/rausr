### Project Overview

A fast-turnaround microsite developed for T3Deco, a company specializing in modular interior architecture. The aim was to present key product lines and technical use cases in a linear, easily digestible format.

### Platform and Experience

The site was built using Wix to prioritize deployment speed and client editability. The UX structure follows a single-page vertical scroll with fixed anchors and subtle transitions. Content sections were designed to mimic the modular nature of the product—clean, self-contained, and easy to navigate. Typography was selected for legibility and brand continuity, while visual hierarchy was adapted to suit both desktop and tablet breakpoints.

With microsites, every screen needs to earn its place—each section should function like a module in the system it’s promoting.

### The Result

The final site delivers a lightweight, modular presentation that aligns with T3Deco’s product philosophy. It functions equally well as a standalone landing page for campaigns or as part of a larger content ecosystem.
