### Project Overview

**Slnko, hrej!** is the debut album by Slovak singer-songwriter Lucia Briestenská. The album blends folk intimacy with lyrical brightness, and the visual identity was created to reflect that tone—soft, honest, and filled with warmth.

### Design Approach

The cover uses slim, decent typography with hand–drawn elements and natural textures to support the personal feel of the music. Earthy tones and photographic fragments connect to the singer’s rural and emotional background. The layout was designed as a foldable cardboard digipack, highlighting both practicality and visual storytelling.

### The Result

The final design creates a quiet but memorable impression—an album package that feels handmade and sincere, just like the music itself.
