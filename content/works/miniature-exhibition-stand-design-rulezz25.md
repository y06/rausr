### Project Overview

For a long-time client, we were asked to design a tiny 3×2 m stand that makes it instantly clear what the company does. Foot traffic is fast, so the messaging and visuals had to work in under five seconds while still feeling premium.

### Constraints & Goals

- **Size:** 3×2 m footprint with limited storage and zero space for clutter.  
- **Clarity first:** One hero headline, which cause quick sorting for visitors.  
- **Reuse:** Graphics optimized for quick reprint and [modular re-use at other events](https://t3works.sk).  
- **Speed:** Finalize visuals and production files in a single sprint.

### Brief & Concept

We built the stand around a high-contrast back wall with a simple hierarchy: the logo at eye level and one clear message explaining what the company does. Visitors walking past must recognize and associate this main message within a second. Because the entire event offers only very small spaces, we included only the essential products or presentation items. No clutter — the whole presentation must breathe. The stand will be staffed by one or two people, so we also considered their comfort.

The staff shouldn’t feel like: Hello, do you have a little oxygen for me? Am I stuck here? Please pull me out.

### Layout & Graphics

The 2D graphic was prepared using simple shapes to represent the entire stand. A clean layout ensures smooth production without unnecessary complications or mistakes. Lighting tests in the renders — and later during production — together with the yellow side plexi panels cut into immersive shapes, created a breathing visual effect, made the space feel larger, and increased visibility from the aisle.

Separation from neighboring stands can be achieved in many ways. Here, we created an optical barrier that maintains visibility and clarity.

### Outcome

A compact booth that communicates in seconds: passersby see the brand, understand the offer, and know where to start a conversation. Built quickly, easy to re-use, and exactly on-message for a trusted client who values speed and clarity.

Parameters that at first seem like your enemy — such as a short deadline or limited space — can become the tension that drives original, unorthodox solutions.
