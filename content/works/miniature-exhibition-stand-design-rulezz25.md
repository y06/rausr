### Project Overview

For a long-time client, we were asked to design a tiny 3×2 m stand that makes it instantly clear what the company does. Foot traffic is fast, so the messaging and visuals had to work in under five seconds while still feeling premium.

### Constraints & Goals

- **Size:** 3×2 m footprint with limited storage and zero space for clutter.  
- **Clarity first:** One hero headline + one supporting proof point.  
- **Reuse:** Graphics optimized for quick reprint and modular re-use at other events.  
- **Speed:** Finalize visuals and production files in a single sprint.

### Concept

We built the stand around a high-contrast back wall with a simple hierarchy: logo at eye level, one-line value proposition below, and a product/diagram accent that explains the service in a glance. The counter mirrors the back wall colors, acting as a mini billboard when staff are talking to visitors.

### Graphics & Production

The 2D graphic was prepared as a single layout so production could go straight to print without interpretation. Lighting tests in the renders ensured the green-blue palette stays crisp on-site and that the key headline is always visible from the aisle.

### Outcome

A compact booth that communicates in seconds: passersby see the brand, understand the offer, and know where to start a conversation. Built quickly, easy to re-use, and exactly on-message for a trusted client who values speed and clarity.
