### Project Overview

A one-page print ad created for Nu’Clinic—a plastic surgery and aesthetic medicine clinic—designed specifically for EMMA Magazine, one of Slovakia’s most widely read lifestyle publications.

### Concept and Production

The ad was meant to feel elegant, clean, and aspirational. The photo editing emphasized natural lighting and smooth skin tones, while typography aligned with the brand’s calm, premium tone. Layout decisions were based on EMMA Magazine’s print format and column system.

### The Result

A discreet yet effective brand appearance that blends in with the visual culture of the magazine, while clearly communicating the client’s core services. It continues to serve as a refined template for single-page beauty clinic promotions.
