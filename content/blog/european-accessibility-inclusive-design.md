## Introduction

{{< quote >}}
Accessibility isn’t just a design bonus—it’s about equal access. And soon, it will be legally required across the EU.
{{< /quote >}}

The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is a new directive that will enforce accessibility standards for digital products and services across Europe. By June 28, 2025, most digital experiences—from websites and apps to hardware interfaces and ticket machines—must meet clear accessibility criteria.

If you’re a designer, developer, product owner, or business in the EU, this matters.

### What Is the European Accessibility Act (EAA)?

- Passed in 2019 by the European Union
- Deadline for compliance: June 28, 2025
- Applies to private sector services and products (not just public institutions like WCAG did)

The goal? Ensure people with disabilities have equal access to digital goods, services, and environments.

### Who Must Comply?

If you offer digital products or services within the EU, the EAA likely affects you.


#### Covered examples:
- Websites & mobile apps
- E-commerce platforms
- Ticketing machines & ATMs
- eReaders
- Banking services
- Transport booking systems
- Hardware interfaces (e.g. smart TVs, smartphones)


### What Does “Accessible” Mean Here?

The EAA aligns with WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)—but expands beyond the web.

#### It requires:
- Text alternatives for images
- Keyboard navigability
- Screen reader compatibility
- Logical content hierarchy
- Color contrast, legibility, scalable text
- Functional voice interfaces & hardware inputs
- Clear, simple language where possible


{{< quote >}}
Basically: usable for all, regardless of ability or device.

### What Happens If You Ignore It?

#### Non-compliance could lead to:
- Fines and legal action at the national level
- Barrier to market access within EU countries
- Reputational damage (users and clients are watching)

Each member state defines enforcement, but businesses are expected to be compliant by mid-2025.


### What Should You Do Now?

- ✅ 1 Audit your digital products (web, app, software UI)
- ✅ 2 Apply WCAG 2.1 AA best practices
- ✅ 3 Train design/dev teams in inclusive design
- ✅ 4 Use accessibility checkers (e.g. Axe, WAVE, Lighthouse)
- ✅ 5 Prepare documentation & testing before 2025


### 🤝 It’s Not Just Law—It’s Better UX

#### Designing for accessibility isn’t just about checking legal boxes. It improves:
- SEO
- Usability for everyone (e.g. mobile users, aging users, low-light readers)
- Product longevity & ethical credibility

As the saying goes: Accessible design is just good design.

### Summary: Why EAA Matters

##### ✔️ Pros
- ✅ Expands digital inclusion across the EU
- ✅ Clear legal guidelines for private businesses
- ✅ Based on WCAG, so it’s familiar to many teams
- ✅ Encourages better design for all users

##### ❌ Cons
- ❌ Can require major updates to legacy systems
- ❌ Varies slightly by country
- ❌ May need cross-team coordination (legal + dev + design)
