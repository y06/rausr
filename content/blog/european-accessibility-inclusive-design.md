## Introduction

{{< quote >}}
Accessibility isn‚Äôt just a design bonus‚Äîit‚Äôs about equal access. And soon, it will be legally required across the EU.
{{< /quote >}}

The European Accessibility Act (EAA) is a new directive that will enforce accessibility standards for digital products and services across Europe. By June 28, 2025, most digital experiences‚Äîfrom websites and apps to hardware interfaces and ticket machines‚Äîmust meet clear accessibility criteria.

If you‚Äôre a designer, developer, product owner, or business in the EU, this matters.

### What Is the European Accessibility Act (EAA)?

- Passed in 2019 by the European Union
- Deadline for compliance: June 28, 2025
- Applies to private sector services and products (not just public institutions like WCAG did)

The goal? Ensure people with disabilities have equal access to digital goods, services, and environments.

### Who Must Comply?

If you offer digital products or services within the EU, the EAA likely affects you.


#### Covered examples:
- Websites & mobile apps
- E-commerce platforms
- Ticketing machines & ATMs
- eReaders
- Banking services
- Transport booking systems
- Hardware interfaces (e.g. smart TVs, smartphones)


### What Does ‚ÄúAccessible‚Äù Mean Here?

The EAA aligns with WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)‚Äîbut expands beyond the web.

#### It requires:
- Text alternatives for images
- Keyboard navigability
- Screen reader compatibility
- Logical content hierarchy
- Color contrast, legibility, scalable text
- Functional voice interfaces & hardware inputs
- Clear, simple language where possible


{{< quote >}}
Basically: usable for all, regardless of ability or device.

### What Happens If You Ignore It?

#### Non-compliance could lead to:
- Fines and legal action at the national level
- Barrier to market access within EU countries
- Reputational damage (users and clients are watching)

Each member state defines enforcement, but businesses are expected to be compliant by mid-2025.


### What Should You Do Now?

- ‚úÖ 1 Audit your digital products (web, app, software UI)
- ‚úÖ 2 Apply WCAG 2.1 AA best practices
- ‚úÖ 3 Train design/dev teams in inclusive design
- ‚úÖ 4 Use accessibility checkers (e.g. Axe, WAVE, Lighthouse)
- ‚úÖ 5 Prepare documentation & testing before 2025


### ü§ù It‚Äôs Not Just Law‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Better UX

#### Designing for accessibility isn‚Äôt just about checking legal boxes. It improves:
- SEO
- Usability for everyone (e.g. mobile users, aging users, low-light readers)
- Product longevity & ethical credibility

As the saying goes: Accessible design is just good design.
