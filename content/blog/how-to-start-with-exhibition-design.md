## Introduction

[Exhibition design](/tags/exhibition-stands-design/) is one of the most exciting, complex, and multidisciplinary areas of design.
It blends **architecture, graphic design, industrial design, marketing, psychology, and engineering** — often inside strict budgets and tighter deadlines.

This guide walks you through *exactly* how to start, what tools to use, what to learn first, and what real-world processes and costs look like.

### Where to Start: Understanding What Exhibition Design Really Is

Many people think [exhibition design](/tags/exhibition-stands-design/) means making a nice booth.
In reality, an exhibition stand is:

- a **temporary building**
- a **brand showroom**
- a **customer acquisition machine**
- a **product presentation stage**
- a **logistics puzzle**
- a **psychology-based experience**
- and a **spatial design challenge**

#### 🎯 The designer’s main tasks:
- understand the brand’s business goals
- create a clear visitor flow
- design a stand that is buildable, safe, and affordable
- choose the right structure and materials
- integrate lighting, graphics, multimedia
- prepare manufacturing documentation
- coordinate with builders, printers, and electricians
- support installation and on-site supervision

### What to Learn First: Skills That Matter Most

#### ✔ Spatial thinking
Understanding volumes, movement, and how people behave in space.

#### ✔ Branding basics
Every stand is a brand story physically expressed.

#### ✔ Technical drawing
Basic skills in floor plans, elevations, and measurements are essential.

#### ✔ 3D fundamentals
You don’t need to be a 3D master — just enough to model simple forms and visualize ideas.

#### ✔ Materials and systems
Know the differences between modular systems, wood builds, hybrid frames, and lightweight tech.

#### ✔ Lighting principles
Light can increase perceived value by **40–60%**.

#### ✔ Construction logic
Understand load-bearing, joints, cable management, fire safety, and stability.

{{< interest >}}
**90% of beginners underestimate electrical planning** — cables, power distribution, LED drivers, and safety clearances.

### How to Design Your First Stand (Step-by-Step)

#### Step 1 — Understand the brand
What should the stand communicate?
What’s the emotional tone?
What’s the business goal?

#### Step 2 — Create a visitor flow
Think in zones:
- entrance
- welcome
- product
- meeting
- storage
- exit

#### Step 3 — Choose the right system
For beginners, use modular systems:
- **Octanorm**
- **beMatrix**
- **Aluvision**
- **Expand**

These systems are reusable, predictable, and accepted worldwide.

#### Step 4 — Add surfaces & graphics
Use:
- fabric lightboxes
- printed Dibond panels
- wooden accent elements
- LED strips for atmosphere

#### Step 5 — Define furniture & lighting
Warm = friendly
Cool = tech
Spot = product focus
Diffuse = soft environment

#### Step 6 — Create a simple 3D model
Even very simple modeling increases clarity.

#### Step 7 — Prepare the budget
Include construction, graphics, lighting, transport, storage, and labor.

#### Step 8 — Communicate with builders
Share accurate drawings, materials, electricity plans, and timelines.

#### Step 9 — Support installation
Be on-site if possible — it makes the final quality *much* better.

### Choosing the Right System or Building Material

#### ✔ Modular systems (ideal for beginners)
- fast
- predictable
- cost-efficient
- customizable

#### ✔ Wooden structures
- premium look
- heavier & more expensive
- slower to build

#### ✔ Fabric lightboxes
- lightweight
- fast to install
- visually powerful

#### ✔ Hybrid systems
Best balance: metal frames + custom accents.

Many fairs have **hidden limitations** (floor load, wall height, overnight work rules) buried in technical PDFs that most beginners never read.

### How Long the Process Takes

#### Small stand (3×3 m)
- 3–7 days design
- 1–2 days revisions
- 1 day documentation
- 1 day installation

#### Medium stand (6×6 m)
- 10–20 days design
- 3–7 days revisions
- 2–3 days documentation
- 1–2 days installation

#### Large custom stand (50+ m²)
- 3–8 weeks design
- 2–3 weeks revisions
- 1–2 weeks documentation
- 3–6 days installation

### How Much It Can Cost

#### Small stand (9 m²)
€2,000–€6,000

#### Medium stand (30 m²)
€12,000–€40,000

#### Large stand (50–100 m²)
€40,000–€250,000+

#### Extra costs
- €300–€900 electricity
- €500–€2,000 logistics
- €400–€2,500 storage
- €1,000–€8,000 rigging structures

{{< interest >}}
For many stands, **graphics cost more than the structure itself**.

### What Makes a Stand Both Practical and Beautiful

- hidden storage
- integrated lighting
- clean cable management
- intuitive visitor flow
- a single “hero” product
- mix of emotional + functional elements
