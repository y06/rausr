## Introduction
#### üë∂ The Original Facebook (2004‚Äì2006)

In the beginning, Facebook‚Äôs design was raw. College-only. Blue header, serif fonts, small profile pictures, and a utilitarian layout. This was **design by necessity** ‚Äî built by engineers for engineers. The now-iconic ‚ÄúFacebook blue‚Äù was allegedly chosen because **Mark Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind**, and blue was the color he saw best.

### The Era of Boxes (2007‚Äì2012)

This was the heyday of the **boxy UI**. News Feed, launched in 2006, started organizing activity chronologically ‚Äî a major design leap. Tabs, rounded corners, sidebars, and tons of gradients followed. 

#### Notable changes:
- Profile pages went modular.
- You could rearrange sections like badges.
- App Platform (remember FarmVille?) embedded apps into profiles.

### Timeline, Flatness & The Zuckerberg Grid (2013‚Äì2017)

Flat design took over the industry, and Facebook followed.

- **Timeline** layout changed profiles forever.
- Sidebars got thinner.
- Gradients were removed.
- Icons flattened.
- Blue was toned down.

Facebook now felt more **like an OS than a website**. Responsive design was introduced. Internal design systems like **Origami Studio** were developed to prototype these changes, built in-house by Facebook‚Äôs design team.

### üì± The Mobile-First Revolution (2018‚Äì2020)

Facebook began to prioritize mobile-first design. Performance, readability, and touch-optimized interactions became key.

- Unified iconography
- Larger tap zones
- Simplified menu
- Dark mode!
- System-wide component libraries (think ‚ÄúFacebook Design System‚Äù)

They started testing UI changes **live in different regions** ‚Äî a practice they still use. Facebook has entire **"dark launch" teams** that release features to 1% of users to observe behavior before global rollout.

### FB5 Redesign & The Focus Shift (2020‚Äì2022)

The FB5 update introduced:
- More whitespace
- Rounded cards
- Contextual menus
- Group-focused layouts

It made Facebook feel less cluttered, more like a community app. Designers like **Julie Zhuo** (ex-VP of Product Design) had long pushed for simplification and empathy in product decisions.

User feedback? Mixed. Some praised the clarity, others missed the density.

### Special Trivia You Might Not Know

- Facebook once had **a custom font called ‚ÄúFacebook Letter Faces‚Äù**, designed specifically for their branding ‚Äî but it never shipped widely.
- **Heatmaps from early News Feed testing** showed that users ignored top stories ‚Äî so the algorithm adjusted layout priority dynamically.
- Internally, **Zuckerberg vetoed several proposed UI overhauls**, including one where News Feed scrolled horizontally.
- Facebook‚Äôs designers rotate through ‚Äúlabs‚Äù where they **design future features that may never launch**, purely to keep innovation alive.

### Summary

From a blue dorm-room website to a multi-billion-user platform, Facebook‚Äôs design reflects shifts in tech, society, and even power. Each redesign wasn‚Äôt just about pixels ‚Äî it was about **steering behavior, building habits, and reacting to criticism**.

I‚Äôve always thought about that design this way: it wasn‚Äôt always beautiful ‚Äî but it was always strategic.
