## Introduction
#### The strategy deck that feels correct — and still hurts you

You can ask an AI to “create a marketing strategy” and get a confident plan in seconds:
- personas, funnels, channel mix
- KPIs, timelines, budgets
- “case studies” that sound like proof

It reads like competence.

The problem is not that AI can’t write strategy. The problem is that it often writes the *shape* of strategy — based on what the internet rewards — not the substance that grows a business.
{{< /quote >}}

Many LLM outputs are trained on a web where a lot of marketing text was produced for one reason: **rank higher on Google**. That ecosystem created a huge volume of polished “SEO copy” that optimizes for keywords, not outcomes. When a model learns from that distribution, it inherits the tone, the structure, and the habits — including the bad ones.

This article explains why AI-generated strategies so often contain nonsense (and why it’s hard to notice), how SEO-era writing poisons “case study thinking”, and how to build a strategy that is both modern and grounded — using AI *properly*.

### Why AI strategy is often “SEO-shaped”
#### The internet taught it to sound right

LLMs learn patterns. A lot of what they see online is:
- generic marketing playbooks repeated thousands of times
- “10 steps” articles designed for search snippets
- templates that avoid specifics (because specifics require real evidence)
- case studies written as stories, not as experiments

So the model gets very good at producing:
- **universally acceptable advice**
- **clean, confident structure**
- **buzzword-level completeness**

But strategy is not “complete sentences + a funnel chart”. Strategy is a set of *choices under constraints*.

{{< interest >}}
Under-discussed effect: AI tends to optimize for “narrative closure”. Real strategy often ends with discomfort: tradeoffs, risks, what you will *not* do, and what you will measure to find out if you’re wrong.

### The hidden poison: SEO-era case studies
#### Many are not evidence — they’re performance

Case studies on the web frequently suffer from:
- **survivorship bias** (we only hear from the winners)
- **missing baselines** (no “before” context that can be audited)
- **confounding factors** (pricing changes, seasonality, distribution, brand equity)
- **post-rationalization** (a story created after success)
- **hand-wavy metrics** (“engagement up 300%” without defining anything)

AI doesn’t “know” which case studies are real experiments and which are marketing theater — it treats them as equally learnable patterns. That’s why AI can confidently recommend the wrong path: it’s repeating narratives, not verifying causal links.

### The common nonsense patterns to watch for

If you see these, treat the output as a draft of *words*, not a strategy:
- **Instant ICP certainty**: “Your ideal customer is…” without research or data.
- **Channel shopping list**: SEO + TikTok + email + influencers + partnerships (everything, everywhere).
- **KPI inflation**: big percentage claims without baselines, time windows, or measurement method.
- **Generic funnel wallpaper**: awareness → consideration → conversion without actual user behavior.
- **Perfect timelines**: neat 30/60/90-day plans that ignore constraints and dependencies.
- **Competitor analysis by vibes**: “Competitor X focuses on quality” with no proof.


### How to prepare a strategy that survives long-term
#### Use AI, but force it to be honest

Think of AI as a junior analyst with infinite speed and zero accountability. Your job is to add accountability.


#### Step 1) Start with constraints (the part SEO articles skip)

Write down the constraints first, before any channels:
- budget range and team capacity
- legal / category restrictions
- brand position (what you refuse to be)
- time horizon (weeks vs quarters)
- distribution realities (where you can actually sell)

No constraints = generic output.


#### Step 2) Build an “evidence ladder”

Not all inputs deserve equal weight. Use a simple hierarchy:
1) Your own data (sales, cohorts, retention, CAC/LTV, funnels)
2) Direct customer research (interviews, support tickets, objections)
3) Primary sources (annual reports, earnings calls, credible industry studies)
4) Books and long-form research (slower, but curated and edited)
5) Web summaries (useful, but easiest to hallucinate and recycle)

AI can summarize across levels — but you decide which level wins.

#### Step 3) Use printed books on purpose (yes, really)

Books are not perfect, but they filter out a huge chunk of SEO noise:
- edited structure beats keyword stuffing
- examples are usually sourced and contextualized
- ideas repeat across decades because they survived reality

Use AI to extract frameworks from books and turn them into checklists — but keep the source list explicit, so you know what the strategy is built on.


#### Step 4) Ask AI to produce *questions*, not answers

Instead of: “Create a marketing strategy for my brand.”

Try: “Ask me 25 questions you need answered to build a defensible strategy. Group them by research, positioning, channel economics, and measurement.”

Then answer only what you can back with evidence.

#### Step 5) Turn “strategy” into falsifiable hypotheses

Replace statements with tests:

| AI-style claim | Strategy version |
|---|---|
| “TikTok will drive awareness.” | “We will test 12 short videos, measure branded search lift and site visits by geo, and decide after 3 weeks.” |
| “Email will improve retention.” | “We will run a 4-email onboarding sequence and compare 30-day retention vs control.” |
| “SEO is important.” | “We will target 5 high-intent queries and track assisted conversions over 90 days.” |

This removes nonsense automatically: nonsense can’t be tested.


#### Step 6) Let AI do the red-team work

After you draft your strategy, ask:
- “What assumptions must be true for this to work?”
- “What would make this fail?”
- “Where is this just copying a generic playbook?”
- “What would a competitor do to counter this?”

AI is excellent at stress-testing your plan *if you prompt it to attack it*.


#### Step 7) Standardize the boring parts (so you can be brave elsewhere)

You can experiment with bold creative directions — but keep operational standards:
- consistent CTA placement and naming across pages
- repeatable icon set and UI patterns
- stable form field order and validation rules
- one reporting cadence and one KPI definition document

When execution is standardized, experiments become measurable instead of chaotic.

### The “best of both worlds” strategy workflow

Use a combination:
- AI for synthesis, ideation, and drafting alternatives
- books + primary sources for grounding
- your data for truth
- a measurement plan to keep you honest

{{< quote >}}
If a strategy can’t explain what it will *not* do — and how it will detect that it’s wrong — it’s probably not a strategy. It’s a content artifact.

### A quick checklist before you approve any AI strategy

- Does it name constraints, tradeoffs, and exclusions?
- Are claims tied to baselines and measurement methods?
- Are channels chosen because of economics, not popularity?
- Are “case studies” treated as inspiration, not proof?
- Does it include a 4–8 week test plan with kill criteria?
- Is brand positioning explicit, not implied?

If you want, paste a real AI-generated strategy you received and I’ll refactor it into a defensible version (assumptions → evidence → tests → execution standards).
