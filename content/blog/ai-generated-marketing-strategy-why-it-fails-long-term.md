## Introduction
#### The strategy deck that feels correct but hits the wall

You can ask an AI to “create a marketing strategy” and receive a confident plan in seconds:
- personas, funnels, channel mix
- KPIs, timelines, budgets
- “case studies” that sound like proof

It reads like competence.

The problem is not that AI can’t write strategy. The problem is that it often writes the *shape* of strategy — based on what the internet rewards — not the substance that grows a business.
{{< /quote >}}

Many LLM outputs are trained on a web flooded with marketing content created for one purpose: **to rank higher on Google**. This environment generated a massive volume of polished “SEO copy” that optimizes for keywords rather than outcomes. When a model learns from that distribution, it inherits the tone, the structure, and the habits — including the flaws.

This article explores why AI-generated strategies so often contain nonsense (and why it’s hard to spot), how SEO-era writing distorts “case study thinking,” and how to build a strategy that is both modern and grounded — using AI *properly*.

If you’re also using AI to produce marketing assets, the same “fast but risky” pattern shows up in creative production too — see [AI Marketing Visuals: The Boom, the Blind Alley, and the Hidden Cost of “Fast”](/blog/ai-marketing-visuals-hidden-cost/).

### Why AI strategy is often “SEO-shaped”
#### The internet taught it to sound right

LLMs learn patterns. Much of what they see online consists of:
- generic marketing playbooks repeated thousands of times
- “10 steps” articles designed for search snippets
- templates that avoid specifics (because specifics require real evidence)
- case studies told as stories, not as experiments

As a result, the model becomes adept at producing:
- **universally acceptable advice**
- **clean, confident structure**
- **buzzword-level completeness**

But strategy is not “complete sentences plus a funnel chart.” Strategy is a set of *choices under constraints*.

{{< interest >}}
Under-discussed effect: AI tends to optimize for “narrative closure.” Real strategy often ends with discomfort: tradeoffs, risks, what you will *not* do, and what you will measure to determine if you’re wrong.

### The hidden poison: SEO-era case studies
#### Many are not evidence — they’re performance

Case studies online frequently suffer from:
- **survivorship bias** (we only hear from the winners)
- **missing baselines** (no “before” context that can be audited)
- **confounding factors** (pricing changes, seasonality, distribution, brand equity)
- **post-rationalization** (a story created after success)
- **hand-wavy metrics** (“engagement up 300%” without clear definitions)

AI doesn’t “know” which case studies are real experiments and which are marketing theater — it treats them all as equally learnable patterns. That’s why AI can confidently recommend the wrong path: it’s repeating narratives, not verifying causal links.

This is also why “strategy decks” often sound like polished copy instead of decision-making. If you want to sharpen the difference, start with [Is Copywriting a Talent or a Skill?](/blog/is-copywriting-a-talent-or-a-skill/).

### The common nonsense patterns to watch for

If you encounter these, treat the output as a draft of *words*, not a strategy:
- **Instant ICP certainty**: “Your ideal customer is…” without research or data.
- **Channel shopping list**: SEO + TikTok + email + influencers + partnerships (everything, everywhere).
- **KPI inflation**: big percentage claims without baselines, time frames, or measurement methods.
- **Generic funnel wallpaper**: awareness → consideration → conversion without actual user behavior.
- **Perfect timelines**: neat 30/60/90-day plans that ignore constraints and dependencies.
- **Competitor analysis by vibes**: “Competitor X focuses on quality” with no evidence.


### How to prepare a strategy that survives long-term
#### Use AI, but force it to be honest

Think of AI as a junior analyst with infinite speed and zero accountability. Your role is to add accountability.


#### Step 1) Start with constraints (the part SEO articles skip)

Begin by listing constraints before considering any channels:
- budget range and team capacity
- legal or category restrictions
- brand position (what you refuse to be)
- time horizon (weeks versus quarters)
- distribution realities (where you can realistically sell)

Without constraints, you get generic output.

If the problem is actually “who we are” and not “which channel,” you’ll get more leverage from fixing the brand system first — [How to Rebrand: A Complete Breakdown of the Process (and Pitfalls)](/blog/process-how-to-rebrand/).


#### Step 2) Build an “evidence ladder”

Not all inputs deserve equal weight. Use this simple hierarchy:
1) Your own data (sales, cohorts, retention, CAC/LTV, funnels)
2) Direct customer research (interviews, support tickets, objections)
3) Primary sources (annual reports, earnings calls, credible industry studies)
4) Books and long-form research (slower, but curated and edited)
5) Web summaries (useful, but easiest to hallucinate and recycle)

AI can synthesize across levels — but you decide which level carries the most weight.

#### Step 3) Use printed books on purpose (yes, really)

Books aren’t perfect, but they filter out much of the SEO noise:
- edited structure beats keyword stuffing
- examples are usually sourced and contextualized
- ideas repeat across decades because they survived reality

Use AI to extract frameworks from books and turn them into checklists — but keep the source list explicit, so you know what the strategy is built on.


#### Step 4) Ask AI to produce *questions*, not answers

Instead of: “Create a marketing strategy for my brand.”

Try: “Ask me 25 questions you need answered to build a defensible strategy. Group them by research, positioning, channel economics, and measurement.”

Then answer only what you can support with evidence.

#### Step 5) Turn “strategy” into falsifiable hypotheses

Replace statements with tests:

| AI-style claim | Strategy version |
|---|---|
| “TikTok will drive awareness.” | “We will test 12 short videos, measure branded search lift and site visits by geo, and decide after 3 weeks.” |
| “Email will improve retention.” | “We will run a 4-email onboarding sequence and compare 30-day retention vs control.” |
| “SEO is important.” | “We will target 5 high-intent queries and track assisted conversions over 90 days.” |

This automatically removes nonsense: claims that can’t be tested aren’t strategy.


#### Step 6) Let AI do the red-team work

After drafting your strategy, ask:
- “What assumptions must be true for this to work?”
- “What could cause this to fail?”
- “Where is this just copying a generic playbook?”
- “What would a competitor do to counter this?”

AI excels at stress-testing your plan *if you prompt it to challenge it*.


#### Step 7) Standardize the boring parts (so you can be brave elsewhere)

You can experiment with bold creative directions — but keep operational standards consistent:
- uniform CTA placement and naming across pages
- repeatable icon sets and UI patterns
- stable form field order and validation rules
- a single reporting cadence and one KPI definition document

When execution is standardized, experiments become measurable rather than chaotic.

### The “best of both worlds” strategy workflow

Combine:
- AI for synthesis, ideation, and drafting alternatives
- books and primary sources for grounding
- your own data for truth
- a measurement plan to keep you honest

If a strategy can’t explain what it will *not* do — and how it will detect that it’s wrong — it’s probably not a strategy. It’s a content artifact.

### A quick checklist before you approve any AI strategy

- Does it name constraints, tradeoffs, and exclusions?
- Are claims tied to baselines and measurement methods?
- Are channels chosen because of economics, not popularity?
- Are “case studies” treated as inspiration, not proof?
- Does it include a 4–8 week test plan with kill criteria?
- Is brand positioning explicit, not implied?


### Conclusion
#### AI is fine, but “SEO-shaped strategy” is the trap

AI didn’t invent bad marketing. It just makes it faster to produce a plan that *looks* strategic without being anchored in reality.

The long-term fix is simple (not easy): treat strategy as a system of choices, evidence, and tests. Use AI to accelerate the boring parts — summarizing, comparing, red-teaming, drafting variants — but keep a hard rule that every important claim must attach to either:
- a constraint,
- a source,
- or a measurable experiment.

One practical “anti-nonsense” trick: if you can’t write down a *kill rule* (“we stop if X doesn’t improve by Y in Z weeks”), you’re probably not running strategy — you’re running hope.
