### Frutiger Aero (“Web 2.0 Gloss”)

- **Origin & Revival:** Rooted in mid‑2000s UI styles (Windows Vista/Aero, glossy skeuomorphism), the term was coined in 2017 by Sofi Lee. It’s now making a comeback on TikTok and Reddit.
- **Visual hallmarks:** 1 glossy, reflective surfaces; pastels with blues and greens; translucent bubbles; nature motifs like skylines, grass, water, auroras, fish.

- **Why it resonates:** Gen Z sees it as nostalgically optimistic, embodying a future where tech and nature coexist harmoniously—something they feel modern minimalism lacks. Scholar Allie Rowbottom notes it reflects a desire for a tech-driven world that’s not “obsessed with humans”—a safe, sanitized utopia
