## Introduction
#### Part 2: from dial‑up websites to “web apps”

If Part 1 was the web discovering **that design exists**, this era is the web discovering **that design must scale** — more users, more content, more browsers, more devices, and suddenly real money.

Start with Part 1 here: [UX&UI in the Early Days: Web Design in the 80s and 90s](/blog/ux-and-webdesign-in-early-days/).

The late 90s and 2000s didn’t just change how websites looked.
They changed what a website was allowed to be.

### 1995 → 2000
#### The “layout wars” phase: tables, frames, and attention grabs

By the late 90s, websites stopped feeling like documents and started acting like *interfaces*.
But the technology wasn’t ready, so designers invented a design language out of constraints, compromises, and hacks.

#### What it looked like

- **Table layouts** everywhere (nested tables inside nested tables)
- **Frames** for persistent navigation (and unbookmarkable misery)
- **Animated GIFs** as UI feedback (and as decoration, and as “please look here”)
- **“Portal” homepages** that tried to be a whole internet in one screen
- **Splash pages** and **“Skip intro”** links (the first UX consent checkbox)
- **Fixed-width layouts** designed around common screens (often 800×600 thinking)

{{< interest >}}
In this era, *being noticed* often mattered more than *being understood* — because a website’s biggest enemy was the Back button.

#### Functionality changes you could feel

This is where UX became business‑critical: checkout flows, account creation, search, and support.
Design problems weren’t “is it pretty?” but:

- **Can people trust this site with a credit card?**
- **Can they find the right product in under 30 seconds?**
- **Can they recover from errors without rage‑quitting?**

**Early UX wins that still matter:**
- **Amazon‑style search + filters** (primitive compared to today, but revolutionary then)
- **Persistent carts** and “recently viewed” patterns (memory as a feature)
- **Clear navigation labels** replacing cute metaphors (fewer “Enter the Vault” buttons)

#### The pioneers (services)

- **Yahoo!** and **MSN**: the portal era perfected. Dense, navigational, “everything at once.”
- **Amazon** and **eBay**: early proof that UX = revenue (search, categories, checkout, trust).
- **GeoCities / Angelfire**: the messy, DIY web — a design laboratory with zero guardrails.
- **Hotmail**: one of the first widely used “apps in a browser”.

#### The pioneers (people)

- **Jakob Nielsen**: pushed usability into mainstream conversation (even when it was unpopular).
- **Steve Krug**: made “don’t make me think” the default critique of confusing UI.
- **David Siegel**: celebrated visual experimentation — and also helped normalize “design first” thinking.

#### 🧪 Not‑so‑successful experiments (but iconic)

- **Frames as a “layout system”**: navigation felt stable, but sharing links became painful.
- **Mystery meat navigation**: unlabeled icons and “cool” metaphors that nobody understood.
- **Flash intros**: impressive motion, terrible accessibility, slow loads, and often a dead end for SEO.
- **Browser‑specific sites**: “Best viewed in…” was basically a bug report as a badge.
- **Horizontal scrolling “experiences”**: memorable when done well, exhausting when content wasn’t built for it.

#### 🔍 Fun unknowns from this era

- **Favicons were introduced as an Internet Explorer feature** for Favorites/bookmarks, then became a universal UX signpost.
- “**View Source** culture” mattered: many designers learned by copying and remixing real sites.
- **One‑pixel GIFs** weren’t only spacing hacks — they were also used as primitive tracking beacons.
- **Text as images** was common: designers wanted typography control long before web fonts were practical.

### 2000 → 2010
#### Web standards, Web 2.0 aesthetics, and the first real web apps

The dot‑com crash didn’t kill the web — it killed the *fantasy*.
After that, teams cared more about clarity, performance, and conversions.

#### The big shift: from “page design” to “system design”

Designers moved from drawing pages to building reusable rules:

- **CSS‑first layout** (tableless design, semantic HTML)
- **Design systems (before we called them that)**: shared navigation, shared buttons, shared UI patterns
- **Content strategy** started to matter because websites became content machines
- **Grid thinking** spread (fixed-width grids, then early flexible layouts)

This is the era where “web design” split into roles:
visual design, UX, interaction design, frontend engineering, information architecture.

The web stopped being a poster and became a product.

#### Web 2.0: the glossy button decade

Visually, the 2000s developed a recognizable “Web 2.0” look:

- **Glossy gradients**, glassy highlights, and reflective icons
- **Rounded corners** (before CSS made it easy)
- **Badges, ribbons, and “beta” labels** as trust signals and excitement cues
- **Big search bars** and simplified landing pages (Google’s influence was real)
- **Tag clouds, RSS icons, and sharing widgets** as visible “social web” UI

And yes: **skeuomorphism** got louder.
Not just “paper” textures — but icons and UI that tried to behave like real objects to reduce fear.


#### AJAX: the moment the web learned “no refresh”

By the mid‑2000s, JavaScript + the browser DOM enabled a new promise:
actions could happen without full page reloads.

This changed UX dramatically:

- **Auto‑suggest search** became normal
- **Inline validation** reduced form frustration
- **Loading states** (spinners, skeletons) became part of the interface language
- **Maps, email, and feeds** started behaving like desktop software
- **More state to manage**: URLs, Back button behavior, and “where am I?” became new UX problems

**Pioneering services that proved it worked:**
- **Gmail**: search‑first email, fast interactions, labels over folders
- **Google Maps**: drag the map, zoom, explore — a new kind of “interface joy”
- **Flickr**: tagging, social photo UX, and community patterns that shaped Web 2.0
- **Wikipedia**: “boring” UI with extremely successful information architecture


#### Designers who shaped how the web was built (not only how it looked)

- **Jeffrey Zeldman** and the **web standards movement**: a public fight for cleaner HTML/CSS and accessibility.
- **Eric Meyer**: normalized CSS literacy and patterns (the kind that became “common knowledge” later).
- **Jesse James Garrett**: clarified interaction thinking and helped frame AJAX as a design shift.
- **Douglas Bowman**: influential early web visual thinking (and later shaped how Google approached design).
- **Dave Shea**: helped make CSS and separation-of-concerns feel “real” to designers (and not only to engineers).

#### 📉 Things that aged badly (and why they happened)

- **“Skip intro” + splash screens**: branding wanted cinematic control; users wanted speed.
- **Flash‑only websites**: creativity peaked, but accessibility, SEO, and mobile support eventually punished it.
- **Pop‑ups and pop‑unders**: short‑term growth hacks that trained users to hate ads (and install blockers).
- **IE6 era compromises**: CSS hacks, broken PNG transparency, layout bugs — progress slowed by compatibility.
- **MySpace‑style profile customization**: democratized expression, but often destroyed readability and safety.
- **Autoplay audio**: a “wow” moment that became a trust killer.

{{< interest >}}
A lot of “bad design” in the 2000s was actually “design without constraints” — the web learning where rules are useful.

### Did any of these sites survive?
#### Yes — and some are still recognizable

- **Amazon**: still category + search driven, still obsessed with conversion UX.
- **eBay**: still marketplaces, listings, and trust systems (feedback loops).
- **Craigslist**: almost a museum exhibit of “content first, decoration last.”
- **Wikipedia**: same core layout philosophy — scanning, hierarchy, and link density.
- **Google**: minimal homepage legacy that influenced a decade of landing page design.

And for the rest: the web’s memory is still online.
If you want to *see* the designs again, the best time machine is the **Wayback Machine** — and curated collections like **Web Design Museum**.

### What this era gave us
#### The foundation for modern UX/UI

By 2010, the web had established a few rules that still shape products today:

- **Speed is UX** (performance isn’t engineering trivia anymore)
- **Consistency beats creativity** in complex systems (patterns reduce learning cost)
- **Design is collaborative** (UX, UI, frontend, content, research)
- **Interfaces are systems** (components, states, empty cases, error cases)
