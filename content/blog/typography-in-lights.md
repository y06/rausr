### How Typography Is Selected (or Created)

Typography is either:
- **Selected** from existing fonts with licensing (often boutique or cinematic type foundries)
- **Custom-designed** to match the narrative and visual world

Designers consider:
- Historical references (e.g., 1920s deco, 1970s analog)
- Genre alignment (e.g., horror, sci-fi, romance)
- Emotional tone (e.g., tension, luxury, innocence)

Everything is tested in context: over footage, in motion, and with sound.
