## Introduction

How Gen Z is reinventing text design‚Äîone swipe at a time.
\
Forget Helvetica. On TikTok in 2024‚Äì2025, typography is loud, weird, nostalgic, and deeply emotional. From ‚Äúugly-pretty‚Äù fonts to melting letters and 90s system fonts, TikTok has become an unexpected playground for a new generation of design expression.
\
\
This report breaks down the typography trends dominating TikTok‚Äîand what they say about Gen Z‚Äôs evolving visual language.


### Ugly Fonts Are the New Cool

Once dismissed as amateurish or dated, fonts like Comic Sans, Papyrus, Impact, and Brush Script are now deliberately chosen for ironic charm and emotional honesty.

These fonts feel human, flawed, funny‚Äîand that‚Äôs the point.

#### Common use:
- Meme-style captions
- Slideshows and aesthetic edits
- Nostalgia-core content

Bonus trend: MS Word-core ‚Üí Using default WordArt styles, drop shadows, rainbow fills, etc.

### Serif Fonts Make a Comeback

Clean sans-serifs are out. TikTok edits, fashion brands, and moodboard reels are turning to elegant serif fonts like Garamond, Bodoni, and Times New Roman to evoke sophistication, irony, or vintage academia vibes.

#### Look for:
- High-contrast Didone styles in outfit edits
- Newspaper-style captions
- Paired with moody filters or analog textures

#### Why it works:

Serif fonts signal ‚Äúauthority‚Äù but feel subversive when used casually‚ÄîGen Z loves the contradiction.

### üíß Liquid & Warped Typography

Heavily distorted or animated text‚Äîwavy, melting, stretching, or shaking‚Äîis everywhere on TikTok. It adds movement, surrealism, and visual drama to otherwise static content.

#### Tools used:
- CapCut & VN Video Editor (built-in warping)
- After Effects for custom kinetic type
- AI tools for liquid text morphing

#### Popular in:
- Music visualizers
- Dreamy or glitched storytelling edits
- Alt-art TikTok accounts


### üé® TikTok Typography Palettes & Color Combos

#### TikTok‚Äôs typography trends are also defined by bold color choices:
- Neons on black for a vaporwave/post-club vibe
- Soft pastels with serif fonts for romantic edits
- Primary red, blue, and yellow for nostalgic 90s themes
- Beige, brown, and mossy green for ‚Äúquiet luxury‚Äù or ‚Äúacademia‚Äù moods

Font and color = instant aesthetic signal.


### Retro Interfaces, Default Fonts & Web Nostalgia

Inspired by Frutiger Aero, MS Paint, and early MySpace days, some creators are embracing system fonts and UI elements from old OS environments.

#### Common fonts:
- Tahoma, Verdana, Georgia
- Courier New for ‚Äútypewriter-core‚Äù
- Windows 98-style buttons + grey panels

These edits feel raw and unfiltered‚Äîexactly what Gen Z wants in an era of algorithmic polish.

### Final Takeaway

TikTok typography is more than just text‚Äîit‚Äôs identity, emotion, and rebellion in motion. Gen Z is bending type rules not for perfection, but to communicate authenticity, attitude, and irony.
For designers, marketers, and content creators, the message is clear:
**Typography is no longer just about readability‚Äîit‚Äôs about personality.**

Ehm‚Ä¶ yeah, personality. OK, maybe. But keep in mind‚Äîreadability comes first, then a loooong pause‚Ä¶ and only then, some personality expresion in the sentence of typography. You‚Äôve got other ways to express your vibe anyway. üòâ
